Leverage Text Processing AI Engines with EvaDB
----------------------------------------------

By integrating databases and AI engines using EvaDB, developers can easily extract insights from text data with just a few EvaQL queries. These powerful natural language processing (NLP) models from ``OpenAI`` and ``HuggingFace`` are capable of complex text processing tasks (e.g., answering complex questions with ``context`` obtained from a column in a table). 

EvaDB makes it easy for developers to easily incorporate powerful NLP capabilities into their AI-powered  applications while saving time and resources compared to traditional AI development pipelines.
