Packaging
===================

    This section describes practices to follow when packaging your own models or datasets to be used along with EvaDB.

Models
--------

Please follow the following steps to package models:

* Create a folder with a descriptive name. This folder name will be used by the function that is invoking your model.
* Place all files used by the function inside this folder. These are typically:
    * Model weights (The .pt files that contain the actual weights)
    * Model architectures (The .pt files that contain model architecture information)
    * Label files (Extra files that are used in the process of model inference for outputting labels.)
    * Other config files (Any other config files required for model inference)
* Zip this folder.
* Upload the zipped folder to this `link <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A7MAr93OS-ACegrPv8wTMWcUrBPazDgK>`_ inside the models folder.


Datasets
---------

Please follow the following steps to package datasets:

* Create a folder for your dataset and give it a descriptive name.
* This dataset folder should contain 2 sub-folders named 'info' and 'videos'. For each video entry in the videos folder, there should be a corresponding CSV file in the info folder with the same name. The structure should look like:

    .. image:: /images/packaging_folderstructure.png

* The videos folder should contain the raw videos in a standard format like mp4 or mov.
* The info folder should contain the meta information corresponding to each video in CSV format. Each row of this CSV file should correspond to 1 unique object in a given frame. Please make sure the columns in your CSV file exactly match to these names. Here is a snapshot of a sample CSV file:

    .. image:: /images/packaging_metafile.png

    The columns represent the following:
        * id - (Integer) Auto incrementing index that is unique across all files (Since the CSV files are written to the same meta table, we want it to be unique across all files)
        * frame_id - (Integer) id of the frame this row corresponds to.
        * video_id - (Integer) id of the video this file corresponds to.
        * dataset_name - (String) Name of the dataset (should match the folder name)
        * label - (String) label of the object this row corresponds to.
        * bbox - (String) comma separated float values representing x1, y1, x2, y2 (top left and bottom right) coordinates of the bounding box
        * object_id - (Integer) unique id for the object corresponding to this row.
* Zip this folder.
* Upload the zipped folder to this `link <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A7MAr93OS-ACegrPv8wTMWcUrBPazDgK>`_ inside the datasets folder.

Note: In the future, will provide utility scripts along with EvaDB to download models and datasets easily and place them in the appropriate locations.
